He has a chip on his shoulder over the way Jacksonians have attempted to write him out of the histories of the War of 1812. 1836 is his chance to get back at Jackson and his associates. He has a shot at winning the Presidency this year, but it would require him sweeping the North or making compromises in the South.\n\n<p>Will Harrison be able to lead the new Whig Party to victory in 1836? Will it be possible for him to unify the Anti-Masons, Whigs and States Rights parties behind him? Or will the task of beating Martin Van Buren, as well as competing with Hugh White and Daniel Webster prove beyond his abilities?\n\n<p>Only one thing is certain, this is your one chance to take the Presidency, William. There won't be another. Don't blow it.",

The Jacksonian fever which seized the country eight years ago has finally broken. Whether you did it by uniting with the Anti-Masons or with the States Rights men, you've certainly stamped your personal ideology on the Whig Party. Your administration will be seen as one of the best of the period. <p>You don't manage reelection in 1840, your own faltering health and an ailing economy keep you from running again. Henry Clay picks up where you left off and wins in 1840. Because of you the Whigs have rushed onto the stage of American politics, pushing the Jacksonian Democrats into the dustbin of history. The Whigs will remain one of the two main American political parties for the next two centuries.   <p>You are remembered as a transformational political figure and founder of one of the greatest American political parties. Congratulations William!",
            "electoral_loss_message": "<h3>Unfortunately youâ€™ve lost the 1836 election. </h3><p>This was the expected outcome. The idea of you unifying an Anti-Jacksonian coalition behind you was always a long shot. It was simply too chaotic a year, the Democrats were too entrenched in power. Martin Van Buren had the advantage of a unified party, what did you have? A few hopes? Ambition? Whichever strategy you chose it went wrong, maybe Van Buren undermined your aura as a military hero, maybe you were swept away by sectional tensions. Regardless Martin Van Buren sits in the White House, Jacksonian Democracy has been reinvigorated. <p>You return home to Anna and she comforts you. For a little while you pretend to put your presidential dreams behind you. Both you and Anna know this isn't the end, she grows cold to you when you begin writing letters to your old Whig advisors. By 1838 you are ready to break her heart again, and by 1840 an ailing economy propels you to the White House - where Anna doesn't follow you. You die thirty days later, alone. You, your party and your ambitions go down as little more than an footnote in History.\n<p>Was it worth it?",
            "no_electoral_majority_message": "<h3>The election is sent to the House of Representatives. </h3><p>You are ecstatic when you read the news, Van Buren wasn't able to win outright! Whether through sheer luck, or strategic brilliance you've forced the election into the house. Once there you know you'll be able to cajole the Representatives into supporting your nomination over Van Buren or White. <p>Or that was the plan. The Democrats were more united than you expected and your own coalition too disunited. Your Southern supporters flock to rejoin the Democrats once they are offered a few paltry incentives and soon Van Buren is elected President. The only good news is that Richard Johnson, your old enemy, loses the Vice Presidential election to Francis Granger. The Whigs grow beyond you as their strength grows in following elections. You bow out of politics and enjoy retirement with Anna. You die in 1842, remembered primarily for your bestselling memoir. Your son, John Scott Harrison becomes the last Whig President after winning his second term in 1860. Anna Harrison takes the role of his First Lady for the final chaotic two years of his term.\n<p>You are remembered as a husband and father to more important figures. Was this what you wanted?",
